# Linear Regression Analysis: Rainfall vs Umbrella Sales

## Overview
This project uses Microsoft Excel to explore and quantify the relationship between rainfall and the number of umbrellas sold per month. The goal was to determine if a linear relationship exists and how strong it is.

## Dataset
- **Variables**:
  - `Month`
  - `Rainfall (mm)`
  - `Umbrellas sold`

## Methodology
- A scatter plot was created to visualize the relationship.
- A linear regression model was applied.

### Regression Equation:
- y = 0.45x – 19.074
> **Umbrellas Sold = 0.45 × Rainfall – 19.074**

### Interpretation:
- For every **1 mm increase in rainfall**, umbrella sales increase by approximately **0.45 units**.

### Key regression statistics recorded :
  - **R-squared** = 0.9171 → indicating a strong model fit.
  - **Multiple R (Correlation Coefficient)** = 0.9577 → strong positive correlation.
  - **RMSE:** 3.43 → The typical prediction error is around 3 umbrellas.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Data Analysis Toolpak)

## Insights
There is a strong linear relationship between rainfall and umbrella sales, suggesting that increases in rainfall lead to higher umbrella demand.
